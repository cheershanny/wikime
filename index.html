            <h3><a href="my-plants.html">Indoor plants</a></h3>
            <p class="sub-h3">
                This is the collection of my indoor plants. It's summer now in London, all of them seem having a good time.
                They are my best friends in this whole world and they are genously teaching me everything about life. 
                I heard them whispering one day to me, <span class="quote">"baby, observe me and fuss with me only if you have to"</span>. And so the wisdom spreads.
            </p>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p class="sub-h3">
                A baby coder was born early of this year. She can "bi bô bi ba" a few Python, HTML and CSS languages. 
                Not much to impress her flatmate, let alone save the world but surely can brag to her 15 years old self.
            </p>
            <h3>Theater</h3>
            <p class="sub-h3">
                Compliment and approvement are all she greeds for. Every now and then, when someone says a nice thing about her performance,
                her ego gets boosted and enhanced dramatically. She thought to herself, well, I was loved and my existance mattered.
            </p>
            <h2>My inspiration</h2>
            <p class="sub-h3">
                The movie scenes, the melody, the pieces of novel that touched my heart and sinked forever.
