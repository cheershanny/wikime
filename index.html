                    🤖 I'm Vietnamese, born and raised. <br>
                    📍 I've been living in 🇻🇳/Ho Chi Minh, 🇲🇲/Yangoon, 🇵🇭/Baguio, 🇻🇳/Da Nang, 🇻🇳/Da Lat, 🇸🇬/Singapore and currently am hanging out in 🇬🇧/London. <br>
                    👩‍🎓 I received my Master's in Applied Positive Psychology and Coaching Psychology and my Bachelor's in Marketing. <br>
                    🏷️ I'm working on customer-facing roles in different industries such as education, fashion retail and Food & Beverage for more than 4 years.
                    Right now, I'm studying programming and planning to switch my career direction toward tech in the end of this year 2023. <br>
                    💖 In my free time, I enjoy connecting with my body through cooking, looking after the plants, experimenting with few DYI projects. Making things with my own hands gives me a strong sense of agency, autonomy, awareness, connection and creativity; those are, to me, the vital force of life. 
                    Occasionally, I find myself in nature, hiking for hours, unable to stop admiring the stunning trees, the chilling air and the unbelievable stillness. It feels like my senses have expanded, my heart is completely content, and nowhere else I could call home more than that moment.

            <h3><a href="my-plants.html">Indoor plants</a></h3>
            <p class="sub-h3">
                This is the collection of my indoor plants. It's summer now in London, all of them seem having a good time.
                They are my best friends in this whole world and they are genously teaching me everything about life. 
                I heard them whispering one day to me, <span class="quote">"baby, observe me and fuss with me only if you have to"</span>. And so the wisdom spreads.
            </p>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p class="sub-h3">
                A baby coder was born early of this year. She can "bi bô bi ba" a few Python, HTML and CSS languages. 
                Not much to impress her flatmate, let alone save the world but surely can brag to her 15 years old self.
            </p>
            <h3>Theater</h3>
            <p class="sub-h3">
                Compliment and approvement are all she greeds for. Every now and then, when someone says a nice thing about her performance,
                her ego gets boosted and enhanced dramatically. She thought to herself, well, I was loved and my existance mattered.

            <p class="sub-h3">
                The movie scenes, the melody, the pieces of novel that touched my heart and sinked forever.
